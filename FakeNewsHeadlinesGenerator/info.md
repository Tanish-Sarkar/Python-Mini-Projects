# 📰 Fake News Headline Generator 🤪

-----

Ever wanted to create hilariously absurd news headlines just for fun? This simple Python script does exactly that\! It randomly combines subjects, actions, and places/things to generate unique and often nonsensical "breaking news."

-----

## ✨ Features

  * **Random Generation**: Creates new headlines every time based on pre-defined lists.
  * **Customizable**: Easily modify the `subjects`, `actions`, and `places_or_things` lists to generate even more varied headlines.
  * **Interactive**: Generates headlines on demand until you choose to stop.

-----

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Save the Code**: Make sure the provided Python code is saved in a file named `FakeNewsHeadlineGenerator.py`.
2.  **Run from Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using:
    ```bash
    python FakeNewsHeadlineGenerator.py
    ```

## 💡 How to Use

Once you run the script, it will immediately display a randomly generated fake news headline. After each headline, it will ask if you want to generate another one.

  * **To generate another headline**: Type `yes` and press Enter.
  * **To stop generating headlines**: Type `no` and press Enter.
