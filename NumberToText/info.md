## üí° How to Use

Upon running the script, you'll be prompted to choose a numbering system and then to enter numbers for conversion.

1.  **Select Numbering System**:

      * Enter `1` for the **International** system.
      * Enter `2` for the **Indian** system.

2.  **Enter Numbers for Conversion**:

      * Type a positive integer (e.g., `202`, `150000`, `12345678`) and press Enter.
      * The script will display the number and its word equivalent (e.g., `202 - Two Hundred Two`).
      * This conversion will also be appended to `numbers.txt`.
      * Continue entering numbers as long as you wish.

3.  **Quit Conversion Input**:

      * To stop entering numbers, simply press `Enter` without typing any number.

4.  **Manage History**:

      * After quitting the number input, you'll be prompted to either `View` or `Clear` the history:
          * Type `view` to display all saved conversions from `numbers.txt`.
          * Type `clear` to empty the `numbers.txt` file.
          * Any other input will simply exit the program without performing a history action.
